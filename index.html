            <p  id="testP" class="funParagraph">On May 5th, 2023 I married Sarah Hayes at Secrets Resort Maroma Beach, about a 30 minute drive south of Cancun, Mexico. Around 60 people attended our wedding, which was more than we anticipated considering it was a destination wedding. Not only was it great that so many of our closest friends and family made the trek to Mexico for our wedding, but also we got to spend nearly the entire wedding week at the resort with all of them! Doing it this way allowed us to really soak in the moment and not feel like it was a year of planning for just a few hours of fun.</p>

            <h3>Wedding Week</h3>
            <p>We arrived in Mexico on Tuesday, May 2nd and didn't leave until the following Monday, May 8th. Since our wedding was on Friday, it was essentially a full vacation that we got to spend with everybody before and after our wedding day. Everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves this week as there's always new daily activities to do on the resort, delicious food to eat, and exciting excursions to go on.</p>

            <h3>Rehearsal Dinner</h3>
            <p>The night before our wedding we had a large rehearsal dinner to welcome everybody that made the trip to Mexico for our wedding. It was a really special night because it was the first night all our friends and family were on the resort, so it was great catching up with everybody. In addition to finally getting to see everyone, we also did all of our speeches on this night instead of our wedding day so we could focus on just having fun on the big day.</p>

            <h3>Wedding Day</h3>
            <p>This day was beyond anything Sarah and I could have hoped for when we decided to get married. The weather was great all week, but it was perfect this day. Our friend Regine was the officiant and her speech during the ceremony lined up so well with the private vows Sarah and I gave eachother. Her words confirmed that we were both making the best decision of our lives.</p>
            <p>After the ceremony, the fun continued on the beach for a happy hour. It was a good time to take some photos, catch our breath, and have some well earned cocktails. Right before dinner was served, Sarah and I were introduced to the song "Sexy I Know It" by LMFAO. I might be a little biased, but you can't pick a better song to come out to on your wedding day. After dinner, everybody went straight to the LED dance floor and danced until the party ended. Everybody from all ages danced the entire night and we got countless compliments on how well our DJ's kept the party going. Once the reception ended at 10 PM, we all made our way to a silent disco on the resort. Initially I was skeptical of idea of a silent disco, but it was actually lots of fun and I would do it again. </p>
            <p>At around 3 AM, the night finally ended were it began, on the beach with our closest friends. </p>
